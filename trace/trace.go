// Go execution tracer.
// The tracer captures a wide range of execution events like goroutine
// creation/blocking/unblocking, syscall enter/exit/block, GC-related events,
// changes of heap size, processor start/stop, etc and writes them to a buffer
// in a compact form. A precise nanosecond-precision timestamp and a stack
// trace is captured for most events.
// See https://golang.org/s/go15trace for more info.
